# Journey
Journey simplifies defining and running persistent, workflow-like processes simply, scalably, and reliably.

Examples of applications that could be powered by processes defined and executed with Journey:
* a food delivery application,
* a web site for computing horoscopes,
* a web site for accepting and processing credit card applications.

Journey processes are designed to be persistent and resilient, to survivce service restarts, and to, quite literally, scale with your service.

Please see `Journey` documentation for an example and more information.
